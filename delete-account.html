  <h1>GarageLoop – Account and Data Deletion</h1>
  <p>
    This page explains how you can delete your GarageLoop account and how we handle your data
    when you request deletion.
  </p>

  <h2>Delete your account from the app</h2>
  <p>
    If you still have access to the GarageLoop app, you can delete your account directly:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the GarageLoop app.</li>
    <li>Go to <strong>Profile → Settings → Privacy &amp; Security</strong>.</li>
    <li>Tap <strong>Delete account</strong> and confirm.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    This will permanently delete your account and associated data (profile information, listings,
    messages and credits) from our active systems. Some data may be retained for a limited period
    where required for fraud prevention, abuse detection or legal obligations.
  </p>

  <h2>If you can't access the app</h2>
  <p>
    If you can no longer access the app, you can request deletion by email:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Send an email from the same address you used to sign up to:<br>
        <strong>support@garageloop.com</strong> (veya kendi support e‑postan neyse onunla değiştir).</li>
    <li>Use the subject line <strong>“Delete GarageLoop account”</strong>.</li>
    <li>Include a short note that you want your account and associated data to be deleted.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    We will respond to your request and delete your account and associated data within 30 days,
    unless we are required to keep certain information for legal reasons.
  </p>
